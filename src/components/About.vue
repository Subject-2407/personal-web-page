       <p id="about1" class="text-gray-500 dark:text-yellow-200">I'm a vocational student at SMK Negeri 2 Klaten, currently majoring in Informatics Systems, Networks and Applications (SIJA).</p>
       <p class="aboutContent text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300">I've been involved in exploring computer, the internet and related topics since I was a child. At that time, I once tried to make a simple plugin in an indie game which I often play, without technical knowledge whatsoever. That moment led me to where I am right now, coding stuff and learning about recent technologies.</p>
       <p class="aboutContent ml-auto text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300">In my school major, I have acquired intermediate knowledge in various branches of computer science other than software development, including operating systems, computer networking, and database system. Thus, it made me realize that these subjects have always been interconnected and have given birth to the name of the so-called <b>"Internet"</b>.</p>
       <p class="aboutContent text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300">
        Well, here's some more fun fact about me. I'm a think-more-than-talk person. I like to listen to music all the time. I enjoy watching cartoons and reading comics in my spare time. Last but not least, I find great joy in applying my tech expertise to solve real-world problems.

       <p class="aboutContent text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 70px;">That's me in a nutshell. Thanks for reading! ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
